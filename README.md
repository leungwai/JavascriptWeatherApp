# 🌤️ JavascriptWeatherApp

_\#Javascript \#RESTAPIs \#HTML \#CSS \#Bootstrap_

Project from Intro to Web Dev class that uses Javascript to create a weather app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is currently not working properly as the OpenWeather API is not loading content.

### Premise
I wanted to create a weather app (akin to Apple's Weather App) that showcases cities that you favorite, and the weather and time for those cities. This was created using pure Javascript and 2 REST APIs (Bing Maps Location Search to search for the location) and OpenWeatherMaps API (for the weather itself). 

### Features
1. Weather displayed (current, next 12 hours and next 12 days)
2. Ability to favorite a city to view in the Favorites sidebar
3. Ability to search for a particular city's weather
4. Current time for that particular city

### This project showcases: 
- ☕️ Use of **Javascript** to load interactive content
- 😪 Use of **REST APIs** to retrieve information from the internet. 
- 💻 Use of **HTML** and **CSS** for page creation and decoration
- 🎉 Use of **Bootstrap** for grid alignment for the various panels and posts
- 🔍 Attention to detail for spacing for various elements to make it look modern
- 📱 Adaptive to various screen sizes
- ☔️ Prevents you from getting soaked in the rain! \(If you check the weather before leaving, of course\)

### To Improve for V2
- [ ] Fix API issues. 
- [ ] Update the front end (it is very flat, but lacks skeumorphism that would really make it look nice)
- [ ] Better better world clock code (so it relies on system time instead of time from API)

### Sources and Attributes
- Bing Maps API for City location
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather information
- FontAwesome for all the icons used in the project
